# Setting up Your Python Environment

```{tip}
TL;DR: There are two main ways to set up your Python environment for this course:
1. Work on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (recommended)
2. Work on your local machine
```

## Google Colab
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) allows you to run Python notebook in the cloud with **zero installation** locally on your computer. What you need is only a Google account, and you can start coding right away on your browser. 

**Pros**:
- No installation required
- Free to use
- Can run on any device with a browser
- Easy to share and collaborate with others (good for your final project)

**Cons**:
- It may not be as fast as running on your local machine
- You may need to upload/download files to/from Google Drive, and download the notebook for submission.

### Recommended Workflow for Colab
To work on the Jupyter notebooks provided in this book and submit your completed work, please follow the steps below:

#### 1. Open the Notebook in Google Colab
- Navigate to the desired notebook in this Jupyter Book.

- At the top of the notebook page, click on the rocket icon and then click the "Colab" button. This will launch the notebook in Google Colab, where you can interactively work on it. 

- Then Google Colab will ask you to authorize your GitHub account to access the notebook. Click on "Authorize" and follow the instructions to log in to your GitHub account. Then you will be able to open the notebook in Google Colab. The notebook is automatically saved to your Google Drive.

#### 2. Save a Copy to Your Google Drive
- In Google Colab, go to the menu and select **File → Save a Copy** in Drive. This will create a personal copy of the notebook in your Google Drive, ensuring you can edit and save your work. We suggest you to make a folder for all the notebooks you will work on, and save your progress regularly.

- If you see a warning that "This notebook was not authored by Google," you can click on "Run Anyway" to proceed.

#### 3. Work on the Notebook
- Complete the tasks, exercises, or questions in the notebook as instructed.

- Make sure all cells are executed, and your results are correctly displayed.

#### 4. Download and Submit Your Work
- Once you’ve completed the notebook, download two versions of your work for submission:
    - `ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook): Go to **File → Download → Download .ipynb** to get the notebook file.
    - PDF Version: Go to **File → Print or File → Save as PDF** to export your notebook as a PDF.

    Ensure all code cells, outputs, and any written explanations are visible in the PDF.

- Submit both the `.ipynb` file and the PDF file through Canvas.



## Local Machine (most likely your laptop)

If you prefer to work on your local machine, you need to properly set up your Python environment and install the necessary packages. Some of the instructions below are borrowed from [Peter Melchior](https://sml505.pmelchior.net/Setup.html).

### If you use Windows
1. Please follow these instructions for installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - Ubuntu: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

2. Install Git. Open your command prompt, type “bash” to start a bash shell. Then run the following commands (you may need to type your computer login password):
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    sudo apt install wget
    ```

3. Install Anaconda for Linux with Python 3.12 (note: not Anaconda for Windows!). To do this, in your command prompt, again make sure you are in the bash shell (if you still have the window open from the last step, use that, or type “bash” in a new command prompt). Then run:
    ```bash
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```

    To execute the script, type:
    ```bash
    ./Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```

    If it doesn’t execute, you need to change the access permissions and make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod 755 Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```

4. To access the content of your Linux distribution from your windows interface you should follow the steps described on this website. The summary is as follows:

    Go to your home directory (e.g. `C:\Users\remyj`) on windows with your usual graphical interface. Among the tabs on the top right click View and tick the Hidden items box, then open `AppData\Local\Packages`

    In there you should find a file with a name like `CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntuxxxxxxxxx`.

    Once in there, go to `LocalState\rootsf\home` and you should see your home directory.

    To do the converse operation and see your windows files from you Ubuntu prompt, you may do so by typing in your Unix prompt: `cd /mnt/c/Users/remy`

5. If Anacanda stops working in your Ubuntu environment, you need to load your `.bashrc` again:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

```{note}
You will likely need help from us to set up your Python environment. Please let us know if you need help.
```

### If you use Linux or MacOS

#### MacOS
1. Please make sure you have the command-line tools installed. Open the Terminal program and run the following command:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

2. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) for Mac from the Anaconda website

#### Linux
Simple: Open a terminal, and stat from step 3 above for Windows.

## Jupyter Notebooks
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks are one of the many possible ways to interact with Python and the scientific libraries. We like them because they are:
- **browser-based** and **interactive**
- **easy to share** with others
- **easy to combine** code, text, and figures, especially with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- compatible with Google Colab

We will be using Jupyter notebooks for all the coding exercises in this course.


{numref}`Figure %s <jp_demo>` shows the execution of some code (borrowed from
[here](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/hexbin_demo.html))
in a Jupyter notebook locally on a web browser. {numref}`Figure %s <colab_demo>` shows the "welcome" notebook in Google Colab.

While Jupyter isn\'t the only way to code in Python, especially when you have to run jobs on large datasets, do large numerical simulations, or run machine learning models. However, it\'s great to get started with Python and learn the basics of programming and data analysis.


#### Starting the Jupyter Notebook

This only applies if you are working on your local machine.

Once you have installed Anaconda, you can try to open up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook` in the folder you want to work at. This will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Jupyter dashboard. The output in the terminal would tell you that the notebook is running at `http://localhost:8888/`. `localhost` refers to your local machine, and `8888` is the port number on your computer. 

You can then navigate to the folder where you have saved the notebooks and open them.

Assuming all this has worked OK, you can now click on `New` at the top
right and select `Python 3` or similar. This will open a new notebook.

If you are working on Google Colab, you can simply open the notebook in the browser and start working on it.

### Notebook Basics

Let\'s start with how to edit code and run simple programs. The demonstration below is done in Google Colab, but the same principles apply to Jupyter notebooks on your local machine. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr4yh1_4GlQ) provides a good introduction to Jupyter notebooks.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr4yh1_4GlQ?si=trzsrExL1T_0oHSp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


#### Running Cells

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb1.png
:name: nb1
:height: 400px
```
Each "cell" here is a little snippet of code. The number `[1]` on the left of the first cell indicates that this is the first cell run so far. 
You can run each cell by clicking the little "play" button on the left side of the cell, or by pressing `Shift+Enter` on your keyboard. 

When you click inside a cell, the cell will be in the **edit mode**, and you'll see a flashing cursor. When you run the cell, the code will be executed, and the output will be displayed below the cell.

#### Modal Editing

The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses
a *modal* editing system.

This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which
mode you are in**.

The two modes are

1.  Edit mode
    -   Indicated by a blinking cursor
    -   Whatever you type appears as is in that cell
2.  Command mode
    -   No blinking cursor
    -   Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing `b` adds a new cell below the current one; `dd` deletes the current cell. **Understanding these shortcuts can speed up your workflow.**

To switch to
- edit mode to command mode: either click outside the cell, or hit the `Esc` key
- command mode to edit mode: click in a cell



#### Tab Completion

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb2.png
:name: nb2
:height: 400px
```
In the figure above, we executed the line `import numpy as np`

-   NumPy is a numerical library we\'ll work with in depth.

After this import command, functions in NumPy can be accessed with
`np.function_name` type syntax.

-   For example, try `np.random.randn(3)`.

We can explore these attributes of `np` using the `Tab` key.

For example, here we type `np.random.` and hit Tab, Jupyter offers many completions, as shown in the figure above.

In this way, the Tab key helps remind you of what\'s available and also saves you typing.

This trick is useful because you can't possibly remember all the functions and methods available in the libraries you use. Also it helps you avoid typos. **Please try this yourself!!**

#### On-Line Help
To get help on `np.random.uniform`, say, we can do:
-  Execute `np.random.uniform?`: This will open a separate pane at the bottom/right of the screen with the documentation string for the function.
- Type `np.random.uniform()` and then `Shift+Tab` when your cursor is in the middle of `(|)`: This will show the same documentation string in a pop-up window. I personally prefer this method because it's faster.

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb3.png
:height: 400px
```

When you need to view the complete documentation, you can do `np.random.uniform??` to open a new tab with the source code of the function.

#### Markdown Cells

Another nice feature of Jupyter notebooks is that you can write text, equations, and figures in Markdown cells. [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) is a simple language for formatting text. To insert a new Markdown cell on google colab, move your cursor between two cells and click on the `+ Text` button that appears (or `Insert -> Text cell`). 

Some of the most common Markdown commands are:
- `#` for headers (smaller headers have more `#`s)
- `*` or `-` for bullet points
- `1.` for numbered lists
- `**bold**` for bold text
- `*italic*` for italic text
- `[link](http://url)` for links
- `$$` for equations, such as `$$\int_0^\infty x^2 dx$$`

We will ask you to write down you answers to homework questions in Markdown cells. For example:

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb4.png
:height: 160px
```


#### A Test Program

Let\'s run the following [program](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/hexbin_demo.html#sphx-glr-gallery-statistics-hexbin-demo-py) to plot a histogram of 1,000 draws from a standard normal random variable. Please copy the code below to a new cell in your Jupyter notebook and run it.


```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

n = 100_000
x = np.random.standard_normal(n)
y = 2.0 + 3.0 * x + 4.0 * np.random.standard_normal(n)
xlim = x.min(), x.max()
ylim = y.min(), y.max()

fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharey=True, figsize=(9, 4))

hb = ax0.hexbin(x, y, gridsize=50, cmap='inferno')
ax0.set(xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim)
ax0.set_title("Hexagon binning")
cb = fig.colorbar(hb, ax=ax0, label='counts')

hb = ax1.hexbin(x, y, gridsize=50, bins='log', cmap='inferno')
ax1.set(xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim)
ax1.set_title("With a log color scale")
cb = fig.colorbar(hb, ax=ax1, label='counts')

plt.show()
```

Don\'t worry about the details for now --- let\'s just run it and see
what happens. Hopefully you will get a beautiful plot!
